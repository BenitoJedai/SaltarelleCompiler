TODO when Roslyn supports it:
RoslynExtensions.GetCollectionInitializerSymbolInfoWorking should be removed (actually much of RoslynExtensions shouldn't be there when Roslyns supports more things)
Signing of the runtime library

TODO:
IReadOnlyDictionary.Keys and .Values should be IEnumerable, but in order to do that we'd need some kind of special handling to allow a class to implement both IDictionary and IReadOnlyDictionary
IDictionary should inherit from ICollection (and IReadOnlyDictionary from IReadOnlyCollection), but to do that we need to support different methods with the same name.
